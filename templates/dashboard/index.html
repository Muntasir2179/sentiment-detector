          I have trained a several Machine Leading Model on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset" class="link-info" target="blank_">kaggel dataset</a>.
          <br />The models we trained are <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>,
          <strong>Support Vector Classifier(svn)</strong>, <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>,
          <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>, <strong>K-nearest neighbours(KNN)</strong> and
          <strong>Decision Tree Regression</strong>. <br />The Logistic Regression model has shown better accuracy.
          The trained model can now predict emotion from a text sequence. <br />There are six type of emotion that the
          model is able to predict
        </p>
        <p class="mb sub-heading">
          Apart from all the machine learning models, I have also fine tuned <strong>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</strong> on the 
          same dataset. It has outperformed all the machine learning models with achieving accuracy of <strong>95%</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb sub-heading">
          Considering the computational power, I have choosen the Logistic Regression model over BERT, although Logistic Regression achieved <strong>93%</strong> accuracy which is less 
          that BERT. I made such choice because, machine learning model is more efficient choice when computational power is concerned.
